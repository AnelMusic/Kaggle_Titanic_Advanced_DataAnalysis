## How to score top 3% in Kaggle's ,,Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" competition
Hey, fellow machine learning enthusiasts. If you've ever had a try at a Kaggle competition, chances are you're already familiar with the Titanic dataset. 

This competition is about predicting whether a passenger will survive the Titanic disaster or not. 
With relatively little effort it is possible to reach the top 30% of participants. Unfortunately, many of the top scorers train their model on an external dataset and thus obtain a model that classifies the test dataset with 100% accuracy. This means that you have to make an extra effort to get into the top 3%. 
Aim of this article:

Explain step by step the end-to-end data pipeline that is needed to score top 5%.
Discuss the thought process of a Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist in Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering.
Make it more difficult for future participants to stand out :)
